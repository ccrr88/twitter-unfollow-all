# Twitter Unfollow All Friends

## Twitter API keys
Before calling the twitter API, you must have the Twitter Developer account and a set of keys and tokens. 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
This should only take 5 minutes or so

select your project settings -> authentication -> OAuth 1.0a, choose read-write
callback url: http://localhost:3000
website url: just filled in smth random

When you want to unfollow friends, you need to upgrade the essential access to elevated access. You need to do it in the dashboard: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api . You need to motivate why you need additional access. This process goes very quickly. As motivation I said the following: " I am currently writing a program in python for unfollowing friends
When I try to do this I get the following message:
tweepy.errors.Forbidden: 403 Forbidden
453 - You currently have Essential access which includes access to Twitter API v2 endpoints only. If you need access to this endpoint, youâ€™ll need to apply for Elevated access via the Developer Portal.
It would be great if I could do the unfollowing via the API, many thanks!"

On the question "Will your App use Tweet, Retweet, Like, Follow, or Direct Message functionality?" I said: It will only use unfollow functionality, none of the other. The app will not tweet, follow or use direct messaging

## Install required packages
The script works with the following python packages:
* Tweepy
* configmanager

The required dependencies are on the **requirements.txt** file. To install them run:

```

## Script Configuration
The project comes with an example.ini file that you can use to fill with your own Twitter API credentials.
```
### Configuration parameters
